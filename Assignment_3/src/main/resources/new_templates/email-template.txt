Subject Line:  New Staff

Dear [[first_name]] [[last_name]]

Good morning. There are some exciting changes coming to our company that I wish to alert you to.

Due to ABC Inc.’s recent acquisition of [[company_name]], our executive management has decided that some restructuring of our department is in order so that our transition through this merger can be as seamless as possible.

This is, in general, very good news for all of us, for we will be onboarding ten new sales representatives – which will both relieve our current understaffing situation and prepare us for the heightened sales operations this merger is anticipated to trigger.

I am scheduling a staff meeting for tomorrow from 12 pm to 1 pm where I will outline the steps of this important transition; lunch will be provided. Please feel free to reach out to me at any time during the next few weeks with any questions or concerns.

Best regards.
Company Manager
